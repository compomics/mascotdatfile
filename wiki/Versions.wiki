#Starting from MascotDatfile version 3.0, all subsequent versions of the library are listed here.

===3.0.2===
 * Bugfix from Pride submission. When the unimod.xml section encompassed in a Mascot results file contains a custom modification with a accented 'Ã©' character, the indexing algorithm failed on UNIX.
 * Bugfix from Pride submission. IPI protein accessions with multiple Trembl references are separated by a ';' character, and this caused an error while parsing the second half of a peptidehit String.

===3.0.1===
 * When more then 10 variable modifications are applied, the modification id becomes hexadecimal ('A' for the tenth modification) and caused an parsing error in MascotDatfile.

==3.0==
 * Initial import of the MascotDatfile library into google code.
 * Note that all MascotDatfile packages have been changed from 'be.proteomics.mascotdatfile.*' to 'com.compomics.mascotdatfile.*'
