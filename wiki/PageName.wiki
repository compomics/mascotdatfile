=Introduction to MascotDatfile=

This library was developed as a tool for the large scale analysis of all data inside one or more complex Mascot() MS/MS datfiles for a variety of purposes.
The main functionality consists of retrieving a Mascot datfile from multiple sources (a harddisk, database or MascotServer URL ) and transforming into a functional object model.
A MascotDatfile instance captures all the data from PeptideHits and Queries into easy accessible objects. Standard methods are integrated into the objects to analyse small details like:

  * threshold calculation of an MS/MS spectrum versus ionscore of a peptide identification
  * sequence coverage of a peptide identification in a MS/MS spectrum
  * processing of modified aminoacid residues on peptide identifications
  * processing of MS/MS spectra
  * etc ..

*In summary, this library makes the raw data inside Mascot datfiles easily accessible for research purposes.*

The library is written by Kenny Helsens ([kenny.helsens@UGent.be] and you can contact the author for any questions concerning this library. Also feel free to contact me whenever you have suggestions/enhancements/comments to library.
